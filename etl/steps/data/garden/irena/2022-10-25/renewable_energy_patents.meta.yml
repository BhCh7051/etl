dataset:
  name: Renewable energy patents
  description: |
    The data reports the annual number of new patents filed under the category of each renewable technology.

    Note that the numbers for the last few years may be subject to a time lag; processing times of patent applications vary and some patents submitted over this period may not yet be recorded in the statistics. These figures will be updated with time if additional patent applications are recorded.
