    Variables include each country, region and World Bank income group's share of the global population; production-based (territorial); and consumption-based (trade-adjusted) carbon dioxide emissions. 

    This was calculated by Our World in Data based on CO₂ figures produced by the Global Carbon Project. This is given as production (territorial) emissions in addition to trade-adjusted consumption-based emissions. Consumption-based emissions are national or regional emissions which have been adjusted for trade (i.e. territorial/production emissions minus emissions embedded in exports, plus emissions embedded in imports). If a country's consumption-based emissions are higher than its production emissions it is a net importer of carbon dioxide.

    Note that consumption-based emissions are not available for all countries; although those without complete data are a small fraction (3%) of the global total. Each country's share of world emissions are based on the share of the global total minus categories termed 'bunkers' and 'statistical differences' (which include cross-boundary emissions such as international travel and shipping.

    Calculation of each country's share of the global population is calculated using our population dataset, based on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/population-sources">different sources</a>).

    Data on global emissions has been converted by Our World in Data from tonnes of carbon to tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO₂) using a conversion factor of 3.664.

    Our World in Data have renamed bunker fuels as "International transport" for improved clarity, which includes emissions from international aviation and shipping.
    Emissions from the Kuwaiti oil fires in 1991 have been included as part of Kuwait's emissions for that year.
