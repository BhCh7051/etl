      Data denotes the range of CO2 mitigation curves for a range of 'start year scenarios': Scenarios are based on the annual emission reductions necessary to keep global temperature rise below 1.5°C if emissions mitigation was to start in a given year.

      For example, 'Start in 2010' marks the necessary future emissions pathway to have a >66% chance of keeping global average temperatures below 1.5°C warming if global CO2 emissions mitigation had started in 2010, very quickly peaking then falling.

      Data is sourced from Robbie Andrew, and available for download <a href="http://folk.uio.no/roberan/t/global_mitigation_curves.shtml">here</a>.

      Historical emissions to 2017 are sourced from CDIAC/Global Carbon Project, projection to 2018 from Global Carbon Project (Le Quéré et al. 2018).
