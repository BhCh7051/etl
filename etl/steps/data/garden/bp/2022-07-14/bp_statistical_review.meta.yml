    BP's definitions of regions sometimes differ from Our World in Data's definitions.
    For example, BP's North America includes only Canada, Mexico and United States, whereas Our World in Data's North
    America includes countries in Central America (see a map with
    [our region definitions](https://ourworldindata.org/world-region-map-definitions)).
    For this reason, we include in the dataset regions like "North America (BP)" to refer to BP's original data using
    their definition of the region, as well as "North America", which is data aggregated by Our World in Data using our
    definition.
    These aggregates are constructed by adding up (when possible) the contributions from the countries in the region.
