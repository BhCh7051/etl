    Raw data on energy consumption is sourced from the BP Statistical Review of World Energy, available at:
    https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html

    BP's definitions of regions sometimes differ from Our World in Data's definitions.
    For example, BP's North America includes only Canada, Mexico and United States, whereas Our World in Data's North
    America includes countries in Central America (see a map with
    [our region definitions](https://ourworldindata.org/world-region-map-definitions)).
    For this reason, we include in the dataset regions like "North America (BP)" to refer to BP's original data using
    their definition of the region, as well as "North America", which is data aggregated by Our World in Data using our
    definition.
    These aggregates are constructed by adding up (when possible) the contributions from the countries in the region.

    Primary energy in exajoules (EJ) has been converted to TWh by Our World in Data based on a conversion factor of
    1,000,000 / 3,600 (~277.778).

    For non-fossil based electricity sources (nuclear, hydro, wind, solar, geothermal, biomass in power, and other
    renewable sources), BP's generation (in TWh) corresponds to gross generation and not accounting for cross-border
    electricity supply.
    Also, for non-fossil based electricity, there are two ways to define primary energy:
    * One is "direct primary energy", which correspond to the electricity generation (in TWh).
    * The other is "input-equivalent primary energy" (also called "primary energy using the substitution method").
      This is the amount of fuel that would be required by thermal power stations to generate the reported electricity,
      as explained in
      [their methodology document](https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/energy-economics/statistical-review/bp-stats-review-2022-methodology.pdf).
      For example, if a country's nuclear power generated 100 TWh of electricity, and assuming that the efficiency of a
      standard thermal power plant is 38%, the input equivalent primary energy for this country would be
      100/0.38 = 263 TWh = 0.95 EJ.
      This input-equivalent primary energy takes account of the inefficiencies in fossil fuel production and provides a better
      approximation of each source's share of "final energy" consumption.

    Additional metrics have been calculated by Our World in Data:
    – Annual change in energy consumption by source: this is calculated as the difference from the previous year.
    – % of total primary energy: calculated as each source's share of primary energy (direct energy and primary energy
      using the substitution method) from all sources.
    – Per capita energy by source: calculated as primary energy consumption by source, divided by population.

    Per capita figures have been calculated using a population dataset that is built and maintained by Our World in
    Data, based on different sources:
